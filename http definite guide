Chapter-1

When you browse to a page, such as "http://www.oreilly.com/index.html," your browser sends an
HTTP request to the server www.oreilly.com (see Figure 1-1). The server tries to find the desired
object (in this case, "/index.html") and, if successful, sends the object to the client in an HTTP
response, along with the type of the object, the length of the object, and other information

Web servers host web resources they can be static files or oftware programs that
generate content on demand

1.3.1 Media Types

Because the Internet hosts many thousands of different data types, HTTP carefully tags each object
being transported through the Web with a data format label called a MIME type.

A MIME type is a textual label, represented as a primary object type and a specific subtype, separated
by a slash.

An HTML-formatted text document would be labeled with type text/html .

A plain ASCII text document would be labeled with type text/plain .

A JPEG version of an image would be image/jpeg .

A GIF-format image would be image/gif .

An Apple QuickTime movie would be video/quicktime .

A Microsoft PowerPoint presentation would be application/vnd.ms-
powerpoint .


1.3.2 URIs

URIsare like the postal
addresses of the Internet, uniquely identifying and locating information resources around the world.

Given the URI, HTTP can retrieve the object

URIs come in two flavors, called
URLs and URNs.

1.3.3 URLs

The uniform resource locator (URL) is the most common form of resource identifier. URLs describe
the specific location of a resource on a particular server. They tell you exactly how to fetch a resource
from a precise,



1.3.4 URNs

The second flavor of URI is the uniform resource name, or URN. A URN serves as a unique name for
a particular piece of content, independent of where the resource currently resides. These location-
independent URNs allow resources to move from place to place. URNs also allow resources to be
accessed by multiple network access protocols while maintaining the same name


URN might be used to name the Internet standards document "RFC 2141"
regardless of where it resides (it may even be copied in several places): urn:ietf:rfc:2141

To work effectively, URNs need a supporting
infrastructure to resolve resource locations; the lack of such an infrastructure has also slowed their
adoption


1.4.1 Methods

HTTP method Description

GET         Send named resource from the server to the client.

PUT         Store data from client into a named server resource.

DELETE      Delete the named resource from a server.

POST        Send client data into a server gateway application.

HEAD        Send just the HTTP headers from the response for the named resource.


1.4.2 Status Codes
The status code is a three-digit numeric
code that tells the client if the request succeeded, or if other actions are required

200 OK document returned correctly
302 Redirect, Go to some other place to get the resource.
404 Not Found, can't find the resource.


1.4.3 Web Pages Can Consist of Multiple Objects

An application often issues multiple HTTP transactions to accomplish a task

a web browser issues a cascade of HTTP transactions to fetch and display a graphics-rich web page.

Example:
The browser performs one transaction to fetch the HTML "skeleton" that describes the page layout,
Then issues additional HTTP transactions for each embedded image, graphics pane, Java applet, etc
These embedded resousece might reside on different servers.
Thus, a "webpage" often is a collection of resources, not a single resource

HTTP messages consist of three parts:

Start line
The first line of the message is the start line, indicating what to do for a request or what
happened for a response.

Header fields
Zero or more header fields follow the start line
Each header field consists of a name and avalue, separated by a colon (:) for easy parsing.
The headers end with a blank line. Adding a header field is as easy as adding another line.


Body
After the blank line is an optional message body containing any kind of data. Request bodies
carry data to the web server; response bodies carry data back to the client. Unlike the start
lines and headers, which are textual and structured, the body can contain arbitrary binary data
(e.g., images, videos, audio tracks, software applications). Of course, the body can also
contain text.


When we type and enter
http://www.joes-hardware.com/tools.html

GET /tools.html HTTP/1.0
User-agent: XXXXX
Accept: text/html, image/gif, image/jpeg
Accept-language: en

The response body length is noted in the Content-Length header,
document's MIME type is noted in the Content-Type header.


1.6.3 A Real Example Using Telnet

The Telnet utility connects your keyboard to a destination TCP port and connects the TCP port output
back to your display screen.

Telnet is commonly used for remote terminal sessions, but it can generally connect to any TCP server, including HTTP servers.

You can use the Telnet utility to talk directly to web servers ,Telnet lets you open a TCP connection to
a port on a machine and type characters directly into the port. The web server treats you as a web
client, and any data sent back on the TCP connection is displayed onscreen.


1.7 Protocol Versions

HTTP/0.9
The 1991 prototype, supports only GET method and does not support any MIME typea and HTTP headers.

HTTP/1.0 added version numbers, HTTP headers, additional methods, and multimedia object handling.

HTTP/1.0+
including long-lasting "keep-alive" connections, virtual hosting support, andproxy connection support, were added to HTTP and became unofficial, de facto standards.

HTTP/1.1 focused on correcting architectural flaws in the design of HTTP, specifying
semantics, introducing significant performance optimizations, and removing mis-features.


1.8 Architectural Components of the Web

Proxies
HTTP intermediaries that sit between clients and servers

Caches
HTTP storehouses that keep copies of popular web pages close to clients

Gateways
Special web servers that connect to other applications

Tunnels
Special proxies that blindly forward HTTP communications

Agents
Semi-intelligent web clients that make automated HTTP requests



1.8.1 Proxies


a proxy sits between a client and a server, receiving all of the client's HTTP
requests and relaying the requests to the server (perhaps after modifying the requests). These
applications act as a proxy for the user, accessing the server on the user's behalf.


Proxies are often used for security, acting as trusted intermediaries through which all web traffic
flows. Proxies can also filter requests and responses;

for example, to detect application viruses in
corporate downloads or to filter adult content away from elementary-school students.


1.8.2 Caches

A web cache or caching proxy is a special type of HTTP proxy server that keeps copies of popular
documents that pass through the proxy. The next client requesting the same document can be served
from the cache's personal copy

1.8.3 Gateways(indirection)

Gateways are special servers that act as intermediaries for other servers. They are often used to
convert HTTP traffic to another protocol.

A gateway always receives requests as if it was the origin server for the resource.
The client may not be aware it is communicating with a gateway.

Tunnels are HTTP applications that, after setup, blindly relay raw data between two connections.

User agents (or just agents) are client programs that make HTTP requests on the user's behalf. Any
application that issues web requests is an HTTP agent.

These automated agents often have colorful names, such as "spiders"

Chapter 2. URLs and Resources

Uniform resource locators (URLs) are the standardized names for the Internet's resources. URLs point
to pieces of electronic information, telling you where they are located and how to interact with them.


Say you want to fetch the URL http://www.joes-hardware.com/seasonal/index-fall.html:

• The first part of the URL (http) is the URL scheme. The scheme tells a web client how to
access the resource. In this case, the URL says to use the HTTP protocol.

• The second part of the URL (www.joes-hardware.com) is the server location. This tells the
web client where the resource is hosted.

• The third part of the URL (/seasonal/index-fall.html) is the resource path. The path tells what
particular local resource on the server is being requested.
